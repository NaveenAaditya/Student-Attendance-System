# Student-Attendance-System

Attendance management is important for every organization; You can decide whether an
organization such as educational institutions, public or private sectors will succeed in the future.
Organizations should keep track of people in the organization, such as employees and students,
to maximize their performance. Managing the participation of students during the periods of the
conference has become a difficult challenge. The possibility of calculating the percentage of
participation becomes an important task, since the manual calculation produces errors and wastes
a lot of time. For the reason indicated, an effective web application for the attendance
management system is designed to track the activity of students in the classroom. This request is
electronically supported and attendance records are stored in a database. Because of the interest
of the students in the classrooms, and this is the largest union in the study environment of the
university or institute, then, record the absence in a department with a large number of students
in a class. lessons are a difficult and time-consuming task. In addition, the process takes a long
time and the department staff make a lot of effort to complete each student's attendance rates.
These goals include maintaining records, assessing students and promoting an optimal and
consistent presence in the classroom. The registration process for student assistance was done in
the form of printed documents and the system was manually executed. In addition to wasting
time and effort to prepare sheets and documents, other disadvantages may be visible to the
traditional due to the loss or damage of the sheet that can be stolen.

Problem Statement:

This project is to develop a software for daily student attendance in colleges and institutes. It
facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. This
system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. By just a click on
the mouse, the system will be able to produce the students' attendance report thus reducing the
need for manual labour which is prone to human errors and time consuming.

User Guidelines:

1. On opening the website “http://localhost/student%20attendence/index.php “
2. we will get teachers login page where teachers can login to their accounts or create an
new account.
3. After login, the number of classes is displayed. Once we click in the class we will get the
students attendance page where we can add his/her attendance
4. We can edit the teachers details, check students attendance statistics and check the short
attendance of students.
5. Once we logout we can see student dashboard option on the page on clicking the option
we go to student’s login page.
6. After typing their credentials, the page loads the students attendance along with their
attendance percentage.

Process Model Adopted:

We choose the Incremental Process Model because it is designed to produce the software in
increments. It combines the elements of linear and parallel process flows. The incremental model
applies linear sequences in a staggered fashion as time progresses. Since we need to focus on the
delivery of an operational product with each increment, we go for the incremental model. Also,
since we have an unavailability of staffing for a complete implementation by the deadline that has
been established for the project, incremental development is particularly useful.
In addition, increments can be planned to manage technical risks. For example, a major system
might require the availability of new software that is under development and whose delivery date
is uncertain. It might be possible to plan early increments in a way that avoids the use of this
software, thereby enabling partial functionality to be delivered to end users without any unwanted
delay.
